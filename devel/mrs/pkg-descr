This "Malloc Revocation Shim" allows researchers to experiment with CHERI Heap
Temporal Safety technologies (including "CHERIvoke", "Cornucopia", and
"Cornucopia with Load Barriers") in concert with a suitably extended heap
allocator (devel/snmalloc-mrs or devel/jemalloc-mrs, for example).

This shim encapsulates many of the policy decisions for driving the kernel's
revocation subsystem, and, so, it is built in a variety of FLAVORs:

- `-cornucopia_load` is the default and is what we expect to be the usual
  desired configuration:

  - An "offload thread" that manages quarantine and revocation
  - A quarantine threshold of 25% of the allocated heap (grows the heap by 33%)
  - Minimal statistics and printouts
  - Use the "Cornucopia with Load Barriers" approach to revocation with a
    brief stop-the-world phase and a single concurrent phase.

- `-cornucopia` configures the shim to behave as per Cornucopia
  (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/pdfs/2020oakland-cornucopia.pdf).
  That is, like above, but rather than the "with Load Barriers" approach, it
  runs

  - A single concurrent pass, during which pages are marked during the
    revocation sweep to catch subsequent capability stores.
  - A subsequent, stop-the-world pass that revisits pages that caught stores

- `-cherivoke` configures the shim to behave as per CHERIvoke
  (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/pdfs/201910micro-cheri-temporal-safety.pdf).
  That is, rather than either of the concurrent strategies above, it runs a
  single, blocking pass through the address space, without offload thread.

The FLAVORs ending in `_stats` are as above but also configured to additionally
be quite chatty about the revocations performed.  You will likely want to be
running under a caprevoke-stats kernel for the output to be of interest.  The
caprevoke-benchmark kernels do not keep statistics in order to minimize probe
effects, and so most of the reported values will be zero.

Researchers are encouraged to build their own variants as well.  We hope that
the pre-packaged versions here are useful starting points.
